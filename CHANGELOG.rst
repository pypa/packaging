Changelog
---------

15.1 - `master`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: This version is not yet released and is under active development.

* Fix a logic error that was causing inconsistent answers about whether or not
  a pre-release was contained within a ``SpecifierSet`` or not.


15.0 - 2015-01-02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add ``Version().is_postrelease`` and ``LegacyVersion().is_postrelease`` to
  make it easy to determine if a release is a post release.

* Add ``Version().base_version`` and ``LegacyVersion().base_version`` to make
  it easy to get the public version without any pre or post release markers.

* Support the update to PEP 440 which removed the implied ``!=V.*`` when using
  either ``>V`` or ``<V`` and which instead special cased the handling of
  pre-releases, post-releases, and local versions when using ``>V`` or ``<V``.


14.5 - 2014-12-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Normalize release candidates as ``rc`` instead of ``c``.

* Expose the ``VERSION_PATTERN`` constant, a regular expression matching
  a valid version.


14.4 - 2014-12-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Ensure that versions are normalized before comparison when used in a
  specifier with a less than (``<``) or greater than (``>``) operator.


14.3 - 2014-11-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Refactor specifier support so that it can sanely
  handle legacy specifiers as well as PEP 440 specifiers.

* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Move the specifier support out of
  ``packaging.version`` into ``packaging.specifiers``.


14.2 - 2014-09-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add prerelease support to ``Specifier``.
* Remove the ability to do ``item in Specifier()`` and replace it with
  ``Specifier().contains(item)`` in order to allow flags that signal if a
  prerelease should be accepted or not.
* Add a method ``Specifier().filter()`` which will take an iterable and returns
  an iterable with items that do not match the specifier filtered out.


14.1 - 2014-09-08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Allow ``LegacyVersion`` and ``Version`` to be sorted together.
* Add ``packaging.version.parse()`` to enable easily parsing a version string
  as either a ``Version`` or a ``LegacyVersion`` depending on it's PEP 440
  validity.


14.0 - 2014-09-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Initial release.
